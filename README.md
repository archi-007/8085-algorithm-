coming soon ......
..... is under construction


This project developing in (GNUSim8085).

First..
start from 2400h memory location and generate 32 random integers.

Second..
Move and Store the randoms numbers to 2500h memory location.

Third.. 
Apply the quicksort algorithm to the randoms integers.
